# BearMAPS

BearMaps is an interactive mapping web application that allows a user to navigate around the vicinity of the Berkeley downtown area in Berkeley, California.
I implemented the back-end "smart" features of this program including rastering, dragging/zooming, shortest path finding, auto-complete search and turn-by-turn directions. 

Data structures and algorithms such as Heap, Trie, K-D Tree and A* search were implemented from scratch in Java to learn object-oriented programming.
